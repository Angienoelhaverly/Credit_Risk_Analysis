# Credit_Risk_Analysis
## Project Overview
Apply machine learning to solve a real-world challenge: credit card risk.
### Project Task
Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as good loans easily outnumber risky loans. We will employ different techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes and evaluate models using resampling. We will then evaluate the performance of these models and make a written recommendation on whether they should be used to predict credit risk.
### Technical Deliverables
* Deliverable 1: Use Resampling Models to Predict Credit Risk
* Deliverable 2: Use the SMOTEENN Algorithm to Predict Credit Risk
* Deliverable 3: Use Ensemble Classifiers to Predict Credit Risk
